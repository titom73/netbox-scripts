"""
Netbox Script to scan prefixes and update IP address status

Description
-----------

It gets all prefixes configured in netbox and if tag <TAG_FOR_SCAN> is configured, then scan all ip_addresses
- If host is UP: mark IP as active
- If host is Down and already configured, mark IP as deprecated
- Try to resolve DNS to report in netbox
- Get VRF from that prefix and configure IP address in this VRF.

Requirements
------------

- ipcalc
- networkscan
- pynetbox

inetutils-ping MUST be installed in your netbox environment

Unsupported features
--------------------

- IP addresses in different VRFs.
